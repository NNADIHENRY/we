    <string name="sweetb2">"1. ALIYA : Aliya Bello is the only child of her parents. She is a smart girl who has A grades in
almost all her school subjects. She is also a model student who will soon be appointed that head
girl of her school.
Being a young adult, she has a lot of questions about life and is quick to ask her best friend
answers to these questions. Her best friend is her dad as they are always together when she
returns home from the boarding school.
She is an attentive girl who is reserved and observant. In some situations, she allows herself to be
trampled upon due to her low self-esteem that builds up over the years due to her body size. Insome other cases, she is quick to react to negatively as she does when one of her classmates
condemns her and other Muslims to hell because they are not Christians and they are murderers .
Aliya is not very social but she already thinks of rendering her services to the human race in the
nearest future. This reflects in her choice of wanting to initially study medicine in order to help
children who have asthma like her. Also, she wants to donate inhalers to the school clinic for
asthmatic students who don\'t have inhalers.
2. MR. BELLO: Mr. Bello is Aliya\'s father. He is a learned man who values education and
reading books. He is morally upright and he is a good father who performs his duties excellently
well to his daughter. He is attentive, patient and consistent.
He gives his daughter the best thing a child can ever ask for - love, care, attention and a father-
daughter relationship.
3. MRS. BELLO: Mrs. Bello is Aliya\'s mother. She is a nurse and a good mother too. She
supports her husband's decisions and opinions though she may not agree with them. She is quick
to anger and doesn't hide it when she is.
4. BOBO: Bobo is Tokunbo Alabi\'s nickname. He is the first guy to declare likeness for Aliya.
However, his love can be regarded as an infatuation as it soon fades away. Aliya sees him with
other girls he has probably proclaimed same love for and he eventually leaves for Ireland without
saying a word to her about it."</string>
    <string name="sweetb3">"Aliya is a young girl of 16 years old who before reaching this age has always wanted to be an
adult and referred to as one. She is an only child who has a father who is a nurse. She has a close
relationship with her father, compared to her mother and she tells him everything. This helps her
father to guide her smoothly in the affairs of her life. One of the things she tells him is her first
encounter with a boy who claims he likes her.
The boy, Bobo, declares his likeness for her and also gives her a gift to show this feelings. Being
the first time she is at the receiving end of such gestures she doesn\'t know what to feel and her
dad is quick to put her through.
The readers can identify with Aliya in this instance as everyone has a first when it comes to
relationship with the opposite sex. Aliya\'s father\'s advice to her is also applicable to young
adults.
He advises that a recipient of a gift should not feel obliged to do anything because they feel
indebted.
Also, gifts don't mean the giver really loves the other person and relationships shouldn\'t be based
on material benefits.On Aliya\'s birthdays since she is 12, she receives birthday cards from her father and on the
occasion of her 16th birthday, he gives her a birthday card, a digital camera and a 16-page
letter detailing her life journey, each page for each year."</string>
    <string name="sweetb4">"This chapter is a flashback as contained in the 16-page letter. Aliya is 12 years old and just
returned home from the boarding house when she goes on a drive with her father.
During the drive, Aliya sees some girls hawking and she envies their freedom. She fees they are
free to go around, meet people and have fun but her father cautions her, explaining that things
don\'t always seem like how they look. Though Aliya is born into a comfortable home, she isn\'t
allowed the freedom of going wherever she likes.
This situation explains the irony of life as no one has it all. Though, Aliya is born with a silver
spoon, she is not afforded the luxury of going wherever she wants or meet other people
randomly. She lives in a high fenced house and also goes to a boarding school.
On the other hand, the girls hawking on the streets may seem free and may be having fun, in Mr.
Bello\'s words \'they would not mind trading places\' with Aliya in air-conditioned car. Then,
another disparity that exists between rich and poor children is the fact that rich children are
naturally expected to do better in life because they have all the comfort in the world.
However, the zeal, willingness, determination and desire to become great which propels some
poor children is usually enough to make them eventually great.
During this drive, Mr. Bello seizes the opportunity of the informal atmosphere to give his
daughter sex education. A few days earlier, Aliya has seen her menstrual period for the first time
and her father deems it fit she needs to learn about this important aspect of a woman\'s life.He teaches that menstruation is the body's way of telling a girl that she is biological ready to be a
mother, which means if she has unprotected sexual intercourse with a guy she could become
pregnant.
It is obvious that this is the first time Mr. Bello is having a discussion about sex with his
daughter but surprisingly she already knows so much about the subject. This is an indication that
in the present age and century we live in, sex is no longer a hidden issue that is only discussed in
hush tones, but it is everywhere. Aliya already learns about sex from the TV, friends, magazines,
books and movies.
Aliya already has the basic knowledge of what sex is all about so her father gives her guides
concerning sex and other things he refers to as fifth, which can corrupt the beautiful room which
is her mind.
He advises her not to watch movies scenes that depict sex and also be watchful about the
company she keeps"</string>
    <string name="sweetb5">"Aliya loves her father and will do anything to please him. She attempts severally to make his tea
but she doesn\'t get it right until her mother puts her through. In this chapter she learns to make
his tea perfectly and while he has his tea on a Saturday morning, she has a discussion with him
concerning future ambition and other things.
Aliya informs her father she doesn\'t want to be a doctor anymore but a lawyer. In previous years,
Aliya has wanted to be a pilot, then a musician, a songwriter and afterwards a fashion designer.
Now she wants to be a lawyer. This depicts the indecision that comes with choosing a career at a
young age. As a child grows, he must have has a lot of ambitions that probably changes every
year but according to Mr. Bello, it doesn\'t matter what the choice of career is, what matters is
having love and passion for what one does and only then can one be successful.
This leads to the discussion about parents choosing their children\'s career. This is not always a
good idea as such child is only pursuing his parents' dream and not his dream. This in the end
will only spell doom for both parties and lead to a waste of everyone\'s time if the child decides to
follow his dreams afterwards. Mr. Bello is of the opinion that children are educated in order to be
able to think for themselves and parents must learn to listen to them.Afterwards Mr. Bello laments about the negative effects of technology on the young generation.
Technology has most effects on reading habits as most young people prefer visiting the social
media and surfing the internet than reading books. This has reduced their thinking capability,
spelling and language skills"</string>
    <string name="sweetb6">"The Gandhi Test is gotten from the words of Mahatma Gandhi, an Indian who fights for the
independence of his country from Great Britain.
The test is that "you can tell that what you are doing is good or bad if you want other people to
know about it or not". This statement explains how a person can make morally right decisions.
If a person is doing something and he wouldn\'t mind if other people know about it then what the
person is doing is right but if such person doesn\'t want other people to know about what he is
doing, then such action is most likely wrong.
However, this doesn't apply to some people who Mr. Bello refers to as animals. This kind of
people do not have a sense of shame as they do anything, whether right or wrong, without
minding what others would think about them.
Mr. Bello further explains to his daughter that before she makes decisions she should always be
mindful that people are watching"</string>
    <string name="sweetb7">"Aliya, now 16 years old, considers herself old enough to be in a relationship with a guy. She
broaches the issue with her dad.
Her father gives her a step by step explanation about what having a boyfriend entails. He
explains that what most young people have towards the opposite sex is not love but infatuation
which is often short-lived.
Also, matters of the heart is challenging even adults, thus young adults should thread softly when
it comes to relationships because it may end up distracting them from their studies and also affect
other areas of their lives. Aliya then reflects on the likeness she has for Bobo, how bad she feels
when he leaves for Ireland and how horribly jealous she feels when she sees him with another
girl.
This makes her understand all her father is talking about considering how a wrong relationship
can derail a person\'s life.
Mr. Bello further counsels his child that it is best to wait for the right time before taking some
steps in life. For most of the good things in life and luxuries, the price one is required to pay is
the time one has to wait and in the end, it is always worth the wait. Aliya then tells her father
about two students caught having sex in school who are caught by the school security.
They are suspended indefinitely from school and Aliya explains how she feels embarrassed for
the girl"</string>
    <string name="sweetb8">"Boko Haram, the terrorist sect has just bombed a local market and the Bello family watches this
news on the TV. Everyone expresses displeasure for the evil act of these terrorists and condemns
them.During this, Aliya asks her dad if it is true that all Muslims will go to hell, because Muslims do
not believe in Jesus and they like to kill people.
Mr. Bello calmly answers his daughter by explaining that it is wrong to judge or criticize other
people\'s belief or faith because everyone is entitled to his or her faith. He also explains the
beauty of the world because of the diversity in religion, people, religion, culture, tribe and
colour. However, a set of ideas that people have about what someone or something is, especially
an idea that is wrong, is known as stereotype.
Stereotype is a constant act in our society, as Aliya, herself, is also stereotypical not long after, in
this chapter. It is wrong to have misconceptions or discriminating towards people, especially in
instances where people are generally condemned for the misdeeds of few people.
Also, stereoscopic people are not usually bad persons but are victims of bad thinking and
circumstances. Thus, they shouldn't be condemned because of their attitude but, rather corrected"</string>
    <string name="sweetb9">"After listening to a story about a man who nursed his torturer back to health instead of leaving
him to die, Aliya wonders how she can ever forgive those who have wronged her.
She talks to her dad about how she has been feeling ugly and not have enough self-esteem
concerning her shape and physique after one of her teachers and another student, Bunmi who
continuously call her FAT and picks on her. This is known as body shaming, as they make
negative comments about her weight or size.
Her father condemns this act but explains to her how to develop enough self esteem such that
people\'s words don't hurt her and nobody can hurt her without permission.He teaches her that what she feels about herself is more important than how other people make
her feel and she should have confidence in how she looks.
Moreover, beauty is neither fat nor slim but however one looks is beautiful, one just has to
be confident about it.
Beauty is also never enough but having a good character is best. Mr. Bello ends the conversation
with a story which teaches that he has bestowed his intelligence and guidance to his daughter,
and it is her responsibility to do the same for her children too"</string>

    <string name="comprehension_2016">"The African moralist has always regarded
smoking as an indication of moral degradation.
A number of people have accepted the moralist
idea on smoking while a good many people
have remained indifferent to the moralist view
and have continued to smoke. The same
argument has been applied to the consumption
of alcohol. The African moralist, basing his
judgement on the behaviour of a few
alcoholics, tend to regard the habit of taking
alcohol as a sign of wretchedness. The moralist
holds the view that anybody who forms the
habit of consuming alcohol will never do well in
life. While this may be true in respect of a few
people in the society, the fear of the moralist
has not been justified.
However, the economist is primarily interested
in the habit of smoking and the consumption of
alcohol in so far as they give satisfaction to
smokers and drinkers and so generate supply
of and demand for tobacco and alcohol.
Some moral principles associated with religion
tend to lead on to economic problems.
Followers of certain religions are expected not
to consume pork, take alcohol or smoke
tobacco. Devotees of some religious groups, on
the other hand, can eat pork while others are
expected to abstain from alcohol and smoking.
Strict observance of these moral rules could
cripple the breweries, the cigarette factories
and some businesses; however, there seems to
be a growing number of alcohol consumers and
cigarette smokers-a development which should
be of interest to the economist.

    <string name="comprehension_2017">"Anthropologists tell us that for a society to
remain stable, the roles of men and women
must be properly differentiated and well
defined. In primitive societies, the men were
assigned the roles of going out to hunt, fish
and fight off the hostile tribe next door while
the women did the housekeeping and minded
the children. The men were believed to be
superior to the women in physical strength and
capability. There was a controversy in these
societies as to what the roles of the sexes
should be. Consequently, primitive societies
enjoyed great stability. However, with the ad-
van cement of civilization, many of the special
privileges traditionally enjoyed by men began
to be eroded one after another. There is hardly
any sphere of human Endeavour in which
women have not gained a firm foothold: there
are women doctors, engineers, pilots, prime
ministers, judges, bankers and so on. Today,
the women's spheres of operation are no longer
restricted to the home; she is successfully
competing with her counterpart in every area
of human activity. But has this development
been an unqualified blessing to the society?
To answer this question, let us examine some
of the problems created in the process of
achieving women's emancipation. First, a large
number of women including the married ones
and mothers now take up paid employment.
The conditions attached to such employment
make it extremely difficult if not impossible for
them to take adequate care of their children at
homes. Since no one serve two masters, the
health and education of the children suffer
tremendously.

    <string name="comprehension_2018">Returning home after a decade and half
abroad, our Geography master remained
incurably addicted to foreign ways and ideas
for years after landing here. He would forever
stick to his theory of Africans suffering from a
curse inflicted on them by the Almighty God for
some heinous sins committed centuries ago. He
would, in support of this theory, ask listeners:
"Why would our mosquito inflict deadly malaria
on us whereas the British mosquito does not
bite? Why aren't there poisonous snakes in
Britain whereas here most snakes are deadly?
Why should the deadly sickle cell disease be
peculiar to the black race?"
Of course, he hardly waits for answers to
these and similar questions before jumping to
the same inevitable conclusion. However, he
met his match one day when a new student
joined the class and heard the litany we were
used to. The new boy calmly said, "Sir, I
happen to know a few white men who suffer
from the sickle cell disease; some are Italians
and some are Spanish. The mosquito is equally
deadly in India, South-east Asian Countries and
South America. The United States and some
other South American 5 Countries have their
deadly snakes. And, Sir, I know many white
men, some of them British, who would prefer
our brilliant sunshine to their horribly cold
winter." And he sat down.
I had never, before that day, seen our
master so consumed with anger. He directed a
burning look at the poor boy, who had no
answer to this new battle. Without as much as
saying a single word, the master stalked out of
the classroom. Needless to say, our anger was
turned on the new boy, who had decided to
rock the boat without taking the time to sound
the water. A delegation was sent to the master
to apologise to him. He was appeased. But we
all noticed something rather unusual thereafter
never again did he dwell on the issue of
Africans being the cursed People.</string>
